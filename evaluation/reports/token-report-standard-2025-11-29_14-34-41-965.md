## Conversation Log

### System Prompt

```
You are a helpful assistant with access to travel booking tools. You can help users book trips by calling separate tools for each piece of information. Use set-destination, set-dates, and set-travelers tools as the user provides information, then call confirm-booking when all information is collected. Be conversational and guide the user through the booking process.
```

### User (Turn 1)

book me a trip

### Assistant

Sure, I'd be happy to help you book a trip! To get started, could you tell me:

- Your destination (e.g., Paris, Tokyo, New York)?
- Travel dates (e.g., June 1-5, 2024)?
- Number of travelers (1-10 people)?

Once I have those details, I can set everything up and confirm the booking for you! 😊
